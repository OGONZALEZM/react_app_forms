Poll & Forms App

This project was built using React Native with the Expo (blank) template, leveraging Redux for global state management and React Navigation for screen transitions. It follows a modular structure that’s easy to extend and customize to fit your needs.

Architecture
	•	Models (DAL): Located in the models folder, we defined core types such as Form, Poll, Question, and Answer to handle the business logic and data layer.
	•	State Management: Redux is used to manage reducers and maintain a centralized and predictable state across the app.
	•	Navigation: All screens are handled via React Navigation, ensuring a smooth and consistent user experience.

UI Components

Custom UI components were created, inspired by Material Design, to keep the interface clean and user-friendly.

Demo

A demo video is included showcasing the app running on an iOS device.
